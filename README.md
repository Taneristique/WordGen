# WordGen 
It creates 100000 random words and supports up to 64 characters for word lengths. However minimum supported word length is 3. Hence if a user tries generating words which contains less than 3 letters or more than 64 characters, the word generation fails. 

## Installation 
1. Make sure any python3 version installed on your device
2. Submit `git clone https://github.com/Taneristique/WordGen.git` on terminal
3. `cd WordGen`
4. `python3 main.py`

## Additional Information 
This program does not require any external package installation. The `sw` keyword in the source code stands for stop words which is used for punctuations. You can either activate or desactivate stop words. 

## Final Note
Please put a star if you appreciated the dictionary you created by using WordGen or submit an issue by [issues section](https://github.com/Taneristique/WordGen/issues) in case you found a bug.
